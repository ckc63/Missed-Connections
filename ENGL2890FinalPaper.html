		</p>
		<p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">It was last summer in New York, a summer filled with a dull ache of an emptiness where a boy&rsquo;s name used to be, when I began my habitual combing of the Missed Connections section of Craigslist. During those three months of summer, I spent many hours pacing the tall aisles of books in the Strand Bookstore, only a handful of blocks away from my Union Square apartment.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t know then why I spent so much time at the Strand. Perhaps it was under the guise of being literary. I admittedly had no patience for sitting and reading a book right then and there. There was always the pressing immediacy of the city, the strange sort of feeling that life was going on while I remained pathetically passive. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was months into summer when I realized there was no utilitarian purpose to my trips. I was merely returning to the Strand in search for a sense of possibility. Perhaps I would meet someone there, strike up a conversation. It was the sort of hope that came with arriving in a new place full of new people. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">But I found something else instead. During one of those aisle-pacing days, I stumbled upon an illustrated book. It was titled </span><span class="c2 c5">Missed Connections: Love, Lost &amp; Found</span><span class="c2">, a collection of Craigslist Missed Connections, selected and illustrated by Brooklyn-based artist Sophie Blackall. I bought the book without thinking much about it. That night, I sat on my full-sized bed in the persistent too-cold air conditioning of the apartment, read every single entry in that book, and was pleasantly surprised. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c7"><span class="c2">Some were endearing: </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3 c5">Freckles and Bruises - m4w - 23 (L Train) </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5">How did you get those bruises? I wouldn&rsquo;t let anything happen to you. You were reading some book, and taking notes. I read a book once. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c7"><span class="c2">Others were bare of context and read like poetry: </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3 c5">Cursive, on Leaving - m4w - (Exiting to the Street) </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5">Cursive, on leaving, stepped on my foot </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5">wish i could have stricken up a conversation </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c7"><span class="c2">Some were bizarre and hilarious, albeit probable in a place like New York: </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3 c5">Seeking Girl Who Bit Me TWICE Last Night While We Were Dancing - m4w - 27</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5">So yea... um, looking for the girl who I was dancing with last night, she bit me twice. I forget her name. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c7"><span class="c2">And then there was the unexpected: </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3 c5">We Shared a Bear Suit - m4w </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5">We shared a bear suit at an apartment party on Saturday night. I asked for your number and you gave it to me, but somehow I don&rsquo;t have an area code written down. I had a great time talking with you, and I don&rsquo;t trust Change enough to wait until I see you in the elevators... </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c7"><span class="c2">It was just what I needed. Snapshots of thousands of lives intersecting or not intersecting. In a large, impersonal city, here was the gentle reminder that we are all searching for something, or each other, or even ourselves. I opened up Craigslist on a browser window and read one Missed Connection, then another, then another. </span>
		</p>
	<hr>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">The mention of Craigslist is always followed by a vague negative connotation, a trailing sense of internet creepiness as certain as the Monday-evening sluggishness of rush hour subway commute. It is &ldquo;Craigslist: that scourge of the newspaper industry, that den of lust, that middleman responsible for an untold number of bedbug crises&rdquo; (Heller). </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Yet there is a different, less utilitarian, more human side to this odd digital classifieds forum. Perhaps it can still be classified as faintly creepy, but it has its touch of sentimentality, a sentimentality that renders it passably endearing. This is Craigslist Missed Connections: that vast digital expanse where messages-in-bottles are cast out to sea, that odd space of possibility and regret peppered with &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;should-haves&rdquo; and the grand &ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; all written in uniform 12-point Times New Roman. </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Pessimists see the bulletin board, which gets about 7,000 postings per month, as an online repository for regret. Optimists see it as an opportunity for second chances and serendipity&rdquo; (Lee). </span><span class="c2 c6">Indeed, &ldquo;If Prince Charming lived in today&#39;s New York, he might turn to Missed Connections&#39; in his search for Cinderella. &lsquo;We danced at last night&#39;s ball, but you bolted at midnight,&rsquo; he might write. &lsquo;I didn&#39;t even get your name, only a glass slipper. E-mail me if you get this&rsquo;&rdquo; (Lee). </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;If you are in search of a snapshot of life in New York, you will find it in the Missed Connections section of Craigslist. It is because the city is made of its people. Every day, there are people meeting and not meeting on the subway, in the street, at a coffee shop, in offices </span><span class="c2 c6">and on rooftops and in bars and concert venues. These almost-meetings </span><span class="c2 c6">involve both hope and regret, and both emotions, among others, are reflected in Missed Connections. Here are the narratives that contain the most intimate thoughts and emotions of New York city-dwellers, a glimpse into the private journal of a metropolis made public, the collective yearnings of the inhabitants of New York. It is wonderfully human. It is New York. </span>
		</p>
	<hr>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">EB White&rsquo;s &ldquo;Here is New York&rdquo; is perhaps the most-quoted piece of prose about New York, a piece that </span><span class="c2 c5 c6">The New Yorker </span><span class="c2 c6">termed &ldquo;The wittiest essay, and one of the most perceptive, ever done on the city.&rdquo; In the summer of Craigslist Missed Connections, &ldquo;Here is New York&rdquo; was introduced to me by by a dear friend. I read the essay in one sitting on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and felt fulfilled. &nbsp;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Like I was drawn to habitually reading Missed Connections, I found myself revisiting EB White&rsquo;s piece. It was because of the sheer brilliance of the work. Writing about New York is like trying to hold water in your hands. The essence of the city is ever-elusive and slips through your grasp and escapes words. But the intricacies of White&rsquo;s prose and the deft manner in which he wrote about the city captured the New York I had struggled and failed to describe. So I read it and reread it and read it again. Soon, </span><span class="c2">I began to realize that the New York described by White and the New York I saw in Craigslist Missed Connections were not very different at all. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;In this iconic essay, White writes: </span><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;On any person who desires such queer prizes, New York will bestow the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy... for the residents of Manhattan are to a large extent strangers who have pulled up stakes somewhere and come to town, seeking sanctuary or fulfillment or some greater or lesser grail&rdquo; (White). </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">In &ldquo;A Supposed Person,&rdquo; an article published in A Public Space Magazine, poet Brett Fletcher Lauer describes the aftermath of his divorce. &ldquo;It was around this time that I also began compulsively checking Craigslist Missed Connections out of loneliness and boredom, which are the same&rdquo; (Lauer). </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Oh, loneliness. Oh, boredom. I confess that last summer I found myself with amounts of both. It was fitting that I was in New York, and equally fitting that I found Missed Connections. </span><span class="c2 c6">There were late weekday nights that summer, far after the opening hours of Strand, where I would sprawl on my bed and restlessly scroll through pages and pages of Missed Connections, while the hum of the air conditioning and the muffled noises of neighbors throwing a party a handful of floors away blended with the faint sounds of the city outside. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it is in this way that Craigslist Missed Connections is a text of New York. Individuals flock to New York, a city of strangers, in search of an elusive something. Alone, the bored, curious individual, also in search of something, opens a new browser window, nagivates to Craigslist Missed Connections and begins reading. It is the same draw. It is the same sense of anticipation, the same sense of possibility, whether spurred by loneliness, boredom, or other emotions we choose not to admit. </span>
		</p>

		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5 c6">&ldquo;A poem compresses much in a small space and adds music, thus heightening its meaning. The city is like poetry: it compresses all life, all races and breeds, in a small island and adds music and the accompaniment of internal engines&rdquo; (White). </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">New York is poetry. In the same way, Craigslist Missed Connections are poetry. </span><span class="c2 c6">In June of 2013, </span><span class="c2 c5 c6">The New York Times</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;ran an article titled &ldquo;Stanzas for a Romantic Season&rdquo; featuring found poetry from Craigslist Missed Connections as a tribute to summer. In the article, Missed Connections are titled with their subject headings and printed verbatim, with only line and stanza breaks added. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">It is true. Amidst the occasional misspelled words and incorrectly used homophones, there are gems of Missed Connection posts that are distinctly poem-like. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3 c5 c6">Black Dress, D Train - m4w - 25 </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">i kicked myself all the way home</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">for not saying hello </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">maybe you&rsquo;ll see this </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">and let me take you out </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">i was reading d h lawrence </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3 c5 c6">cheQov on Q - w4w - 29 (brooklyn)</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">you were the pretty blonde woman not reading uncle vanya on the train and people watching. we were both watching the boy with glasses. he kissed his girlfriend in the blue dress. &ldquo;happy birthday,&rdquo; he said. she got off the train and he watched her go. then he tripped over himself.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">it was a sweet, chekhovian moment and you looked like you enjoyed it as much as I, as though you saw all of our earthbound humanity, the whole foolish, lovely thing, beginning to end, in that one moment. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">when I was getting off the train, you looked sideways at me and saw that I was looking at you. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">hi! hello. hi.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c10 c7"><span class="c2 c6">Missed Connections are like </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;literary graffiti&rdquo; (Shultz). Just as the city embodies poetry, there are Missed Connections that do the same, whether manifested through </span><span class="c2 c6">the spacing or form, the word choice, the careful referencing, the deliberate brevity or the Bukowski-esque lack of capitalization. And so here is New York, here are Missed Connections. Here is poetry. </span>
		</p>
	<hr>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Missed Connections is surrounded by an air of mystery that invites closer examination. In 2012, employees of Craigslist itself conducted a month-long study of nearly 500 Missed Connections posts, a study in which the Morgan Avenue Station on 14th Street </span><span class="c2 c6">&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Canarsie Line (L train) was named New York&rsquo;s most romantic subway station. There have been a handful of studies that attempt to make sense of this constantly refreshing repository of the city&rsquo;s almost-meetings. These studies ask questions. Who is authoring these postings? Where are these missed connections occurring? </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">During the last week of April, I browsed Missed Connections every day for a week and collected the postings that caught my eye. It was an enjoyable way to pass time, a sort of reality entertainment that melded private and public. Reading about others&rsquo; lives from far away was like experiencing the New York described by White, a New York that had an odd ability to blend </span><span class="c2 c5 c6">&ldquo;... the gift of privacy with the excitement of participation&rdquo; (White). </span><span class="c2">And so I read Missed Connections and people watched from my desk. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1 c12"><span class="c2">Of the multitude of postings that surfaced on the forum during that given week, I saved 43. These were postings that stood out for some reason or another, whether it was through personal connection or humor or eloquence or oddity. There was &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3 c5">You were walking your dog; it sneezed. You were cute - m4m (Midtown East), &rdquo; &ldquo;72nd St Trader Joes, By the Tomatoes - m4m - 25 (Upper West Side)</span><span class="c2 c3 c5 c13">,&rdquo; &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3 c5">to the poetry boy on D Line to Atlantic Ave - w4m&rdquo;, &ldquo;two different colored shoes - w4w (Union Square).&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">I copied and pasted the 43 Missed Connections into a Word Document, a textual mosaic of sorts. Of these 43 postings, 23 were men searching for women. 9 were women searching for men. 11 were men searching for men. One was a woman searching for a woman. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">As for where people were missing each other? According to </span><span class="c2 c5">Psychology Today</span><span class="c2">, the majority of Missed Connections posted on New York City&rsquo;s Craigslist occur on the subway. This comes as no surprise. As the busiest rapid transit system in the states, the subway is </span><span class="c2 c6">where New Yorkers</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;rub elbows with the rest of humanity. Of the 43 postings I collected, 21 of these Missed Connections occurred in a subway station, a figure that echoed </span><span class="c2 c5">Psychology Today</span><span class="c2">&rsquo;s findings. 8 occurred in the street or a park either walking or biking. 5 occurred in a coffee shop. One occurred in a bookstore. One occurred in a clothing store. One occurred in a grocery store, a Trader Joe&rsquo;s to be exact, by the tomatoes. One occurred in an Apple store at the Genius Bar. One occurred in an art gallery. One occurred in a bar. One occurred in a deli with an ice cream bar. One occurred in a movie theatre. One listed no location. These are the glimpses we catch of people, the blurs of human bodies in motion, the locations where we almost meet each other, where we fail to do so, and where we retreat to the Internet in hope of another chance. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c12"><span class="c2 c3 c5">72nd St Trader Joes, By the Tomatoes - m4m - 25 (Upper West Side)</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c12"><span class="c2 c5 c6">You were wearing your headphones and blue suede oxfords, with part bleached hair. I was in a brown leather jacket and green gym shoes getting tomatoes - maybe to make you shakshouka one morning - when you came out of the check-out line to grab a veggie, too. By the time I thought of four good pick-up lines I was already at the back of the line. When I finally got to the front I was relieved to see you were still checking out, while I was not-so-subtly checking you out. I fumbled while signing for my credit card and clicked cancel, had to start over in a hurry. If you had finished first and passed me by on your way out, I was half-ready to give a sly smile and say, &quot;I&#39;ll be done in a minute if you want to wait for me upstairs.&quot; But it couldn&#39;t work if I checked out before you did, I couldn&#39;t wait around like a creeper. So write me back, handsome stranger. It could be a match made at Trader Joe&#39;s.</span>
		</p>
	<hr>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">There are certain categories of Missed Connections that surface again and again. There are posts that follow the traditional formula and contain the location, the time, a brief description of the person sighted, a general note of regret at not making contact. There are posts written to a known person who is inaccessible, such as postings to famous people, dead people, ex-boyfriends, ex-girlfriends, or long-lost-something-or-others. There are posts written to hypothetical people. There are postings that are vague, postings that are specific. Some are written moments after the encounter took place, complete with rushed misspellings. Others are written months, years, or even decades later. Indeed, the content of these Craigslist Missed Connections is as varied as New York&rsquo;s inhabitants. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yet, like the city, though there is categorical variation in Missed Connection posts, an odd sort of stasis still pervades. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5 c6">&ldquo;To a New Yorker the city is both changeless and changing. In many respects it neither looks nor feels the way it did twenty-five years ago. The elevated railways have been pulled down, all but Third Avenue. An old-timer walking up Sixth past the Jefferson Market jail misses the railroad, misses its sound, its spotted shade, its little aerial stations, and the tremor of the thing. Broadway has changed in aspect. It used to have a discernable bony structure beneath its loud bright surface; but the signs are so enormous now, the buildings and shops and hotels have largely disappeared under the neon lights and the frozen custard-facade...&rdquo; (White) </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c7"><span class="c2 c6">C</span><span class="c2 c6">raigslist p</span><span class="c2">osts self-destruct every forty five days</span><span class="c2 c6">. </span><span class="c2">Old posts are buried by new ones, and older entries disappear after their allotted forty five day life span is expended. I was simultaneously intrigued and saddened by the fact these missives would disappear in a handful of days, lost forever to wherever remaining bits of the internet tend to go. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yet I realized that even as new Missed Connections postings sprout up, they continue to contain the same themes, the same phrasings, the same sentiments. </span><span class="c2 c5">Write me. Drop me a line. Tell me what I was reading so I know it&rsquo;s you.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;And in that manner, the entries do not change at all. The cycle of Missed Connections is like the city, variations upon a theme, constantly renewing and refreshing yet remaining constant, changeless and changing all at once. </span>
		</p>
	<hr>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Each day, we </span><span class="c2">step outside into the city. It is a city full of swirling intimacies of daily life that are often rushed through and unrealized. Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere. Somewhere in the city there are thoughts and inaction and regret and hope. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Somewhere, a barista is making coffee for a girl with the warmest smile she has seen. As she grinds espresso beans with care, she thinks of gently asking for her number as well as her name. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">A boy is not looking at a modern abstract painting in the MoMa because he has spotted a girl with the most beautiful red bow in her hair. He imagines exploring each museum in the city with her at his side. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">A man is attentively reading a dog-eared copy of EB White&rsquo;s &ldquo;Here is New York&rdquo; on the Brooklyn-bound L train. A woman notices and pauses to think of the time she read White&rsquo;s essay in her university literature seminar years ago.</span><span class="c2 c5 c6">&ldquo;A poem compresses much in a small space and adds music, thus heightening its meaning. The city is like poetry: it compresses all life, all races and breeds, in a small island and adds music and the accompaniment of internal engines...&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;She smiles at him. She thinks the man is a poem with feet. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">And s</span><span class="c2">omewhere, in the drizzle of summer rain, a girl sees a boy with a flower umbrella smiling at her from across the street. She wants to walk over and begin a conversation, but does not. And then he is gone. Somewhere, the girl ducks into an air-conditioned coffee shop. </span><span class="c2 c5">To escape the rain</span><span class="c2">, she tells herself. But she ducks into the coffee shop to grab WiFi. She types a message and casts it off to the sea of Missed Connections. This connected world. This lonely world. This hopeful world. </span><span class="c2 c5">I never do this</span><span class="c2">, she writes, but smiles anyways as she secretly imagines him seeing the message. She imagines a future months later, a sunlight-filled future where she wakes up smiling because he makes her feel safe. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c2">And somewhere else, I am sitting on a damp bench in Washington Square Park in the sunlight after the rain, reading the message and filling the white spaces with imaginary details. It&rsquo;s odd and it&rsquo;s human and it&rsquo;s wonderful. </span><span class="c2 c5">Write me. Drop me a line. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">Tell me what I was wearing so I know it&rsquo;s you. </span>
		</p>
